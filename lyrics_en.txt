 Lyrics:
[Intro: The Weeknd]
Oh woah, woah, oh, oh
Oh, woah, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Like a moth to a flame
I'll pull you in, I'll pull you back to
What you need initially (Oh-oh, oh)
It's just one call away, ayy, ayy
And you'll leave him, you're loyal to me
But this time I'll let you be

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
'Cause he seems like he's good for you
And he makes you feel like you should
And all your friends say, "He's the one"
His love for you is true, ooh-ooh

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
But does he know you call me when he sleeps?
Or does he know the pictures that you keep?
Or does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies?
[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Yeah, you should be with him, I let you go from time (Uh, yeah)
You should stay with him

[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
'Cause he seems like he's good for you
And he makes you feel like you should
And all your friends say, "He's the one"
His love for you is true, ooh-ooh (Ooh)

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
But does he know you call me when he sleeps? (No-no, oh)
Or does he know the pictures that you keep? (Oh)
Or does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies?

[Outro: The Weeknd]
Right here with me, baby
Where it truly lies
My baby
Where it truly lies
Give me all of it
Where it truly lies
Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh
Where it truly lies
Where it truly lies
Hey
Where it truly lies
