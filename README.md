## Zipf's Law of Abbreviation: A Comparative Study of Greek and English Songs

# Project Overview

This project examines Zipf's Law of Abbreviation by analyzing the word lengths in a Greek song and an English song. Zipf's Law of Abbreviation suggests that frequently used words tend to be shorter. By comparing the word distributions in both languages, this study explores whether the principle holds across linguistic boundaries.

# Methodology

1. Song Selection

One Greek song and one English song were chosen for analysis.

The lyrics were cleaned for processing.

2. Text Processing

Tokenization: Lyrics were split into individual words.

Word Length Calculation: The length of each word was measured.

Frequency Analysis: The occurrence of each word was counted.

3. Data Analysis

Distribution of word lengths was compared between the two languages.

Visualization of frequency vs. word length was created to assess adherence to Zipf's Law of Abbreviation.

# Results

The study aims to determine whether Greek and English follow similar trends in word-length distribution.

Findings may indicate linguistic tendencies in abbreviation and efficiency of communication in songs.

# Technologies Used
